# Nasal-Interpreter

# Nasal

Nasal is a script language that used in FlightGear.

There is a Nasal console in FlightGear but sometimes it is not so easy for every developer to use.

So this is an interpreter for Nasal written by C++.

The interpreter is still in development.Anyone who interested in this could also join us!
